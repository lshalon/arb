A party will be considered to have 'control' of the House of Representatives, if they win a majority of voting seats.

A party will be considered to have 'control' of the Senate if they have more than half of the voting Senate members, or half of the voting Senate members and the Vice President. 

A candidate's party is determined by their ballot-listed or otherwise identifiable affiliation with that party at the time the 2024 House, Senate and Presidency are conclusively called by this market's resolution sources. A candidate without a ballot-listed affiliation to either the Democrat or Republican Parties will be considered a member of one of these parties based on the party that they most recently expressed their intent to caucus with at the time the 2024 House, Senate and Presidency are conclusively called by this market's resolution sources.

If control of the House is ambiguous given the above rules, this market will resolve according to the party affiliation of the first Speaker of the US House who is selected following the 2024 US general election.

If control of the Senate is ambiguous given the above rules, this market will resolve according to the party affiliation of the first Majority Leader of the US Senate who is selected following the 2024 US general election.

The resolution source for this market is the Associated Press, Fox News, and NBC.

This market will resolve based on the total number of votes in the 2024 Presidential election according to uselectionatlas.org once their dataset includes the certified vote totals for all U.S. States and the District of Columbia. If a recount is initiated before certification, the market will remain open until the recount is completed and the vote is certified. If a recount occurs after uselectionatlas.org has published vote totals based on the final certifications, the recount will not be considered. 

If there are no outstanding recounts, and electionatlas.org has not published total vote numbers based on the state certified results by December 17, 2024, 12:00 PM ET, this market will resolve according to the total vote numbers from the United States Elections Project (electproject.org).

This market will resolve to ""Alaska” if Donald Trump's margin of victory winning the popular vote in Alaska is higher than his margin of victory winning the popular vote in Florida in the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election. 

For the purpose of resolving this market, the 'margin of victory' is defined as the absolute difference between the percentages of votes received by Donald Trump and the second-place candidate. Percentages of the votes received by each party will be determined by dividing the total number of votes received by each Donald Trump and the second place candidate by the sum of all votes cast in Florida and Alaska each for the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election.

If Donald Trump loses both states, this market will resolve based off the state in which he had a smaller margin of defeat between himself and the first place candidate.

This market will resolve based off the official vote count once both relevant states have certified the vote.

If a recount is initiated in either state before certification, this market will remain open until the recount is completed and the vote is certified.

If Trump loses the 2024 US Presidential election, this market will immediately resolve to ""No"". The resolution source for Trump winning the presidency is the Associated Press, Fox News, and NBC. This portion of the market will resolve once all three sources call the race for the same candidate. If all three sources haven’t called the race for the same candidate by the inauguration date (January 20, 2025) this market will resolve based on who is inaugurated.

To count toward the resolution of this market, an armistice, ceasefire, and/or negotiated settlement must be indicative of at least the temporary end of the Ukraine-Russia military conflict, must pertain to all theaters of military conflict between the two countries, and be declared through official channels by both countries. The specific date that such an agreement will take effect is not relevant to the resolution of this market. The only requirement is that the agreement must be announced within this market's specified timeframe.

This market will resolve based on the first announcement of such an armistice, ceasefire, and/or negotiated settlement. If it is first announced before this market's timeframe, this market will immediately resolve to ""No"".

This market will resolve to ""Ohio” if Donald Trump's margin of victory winning the popular vote in Ohio is higher than his margin of victory winning the popular vote in Florida in the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election.

For the purpose of resolving this market, the 'margin of victory' is defined as the absolute difference between the percentages of votes received by Donald Trump and the second-place candidate.

A concession is defined as an unambiguous public statement which acknowledges that the candidate lost the 2024 US presidential election, will not be the next President, or which acknowledges the victory of an opponent. If a candidate makes these acknowledgements while also claiming that the election was rigged, or that there was fraud, this will still qualify as a concession.

Any public statement from Trump written or verbal will qualify.  Speeches in which Trump begins speaking within the time frame of this market will qualify, even if his declaration of victory falls outside the markets timeframe.

Only public statements from Donald Trump will qualify. Reports of private conversations, e.g. if the candidate called the victor and conceded over the phone, will not count.

Only recounts which are either automatically triggered, requested by either Kamala Harris or Donald Trump, or ordered independently by a court or state official will qualify. Recounts requested by third party candidates, such as the 2016 Wisconsin recount requested by Green Party candidate Jill Stein would not qualify. 

Any full statewide recount, whether conducted by hand or machine will count. However, partial recounts such as the 2020 Wisconsin recount, which only included Milwaukee and Dane counties, or the 2004 Ohio recount which used a sample of 3% of precincts in each county would NOT count. 

A recount is defined as a formal re-tallying of votes. Any complete re-tallying of the vote will count as a recount, even if officially described as ‘audit’ such as the initial 2020 Georgia recount completed on November 19. 

The resolution source will be official information from the relevant election authorities.

If the legal deadline to initiate a recount has passed in every participating territory in the 2024 U.S. Presidential election, and there are no formal or legal process underway to initiate a recount, this market may resolve to ""No"".

Otherwise, this market will resolve to “No”. 

To flip a jurisdiction, the number of additional votes allocated must be sufficient to give the second-place candidate a lead in that jurisdiction’s popular vote.

Allocations that would result in a tie in any jurisdiction will not qualify, regardless of that jurisdiction's tie-breaker rules.

For purposes of this market, a candidate will be considered to have won all electoral votes from a territory if they win the plurality of the votes, faithless electors will not be considered.

This market will resolve based on vote totals for the 2024 Presidential election according to uselectionatlas.org once their dataset includes the certified vote totals for all U.S. States and the District of Columbia. If a recount is initiated before certification, the market will remain open until the recount is completed and the vote is certified. If a recount occurs after uselectionatlas.org has published vote totals based on the final certifications, the recount will not be considered.

If there are no outstanding recounts, and electionatlas.org has not published vote totals based on the state certified results by December 17, 2024, 12:00 PM ET, this market will resolve according to the total vote numbers from the United States Elections Project (electproject.org).

Percentages of the votes received by each party will be determined by dividing the total number of votes each of the top two candidates receives by the sum of all votes cast in the 2024 Arizona US Senate election.

This market will resolve based off the official vote count once Arizona has certified the vote for this race.

If a recount is initiated before certification, the market will remain open until the recount is completed and the vote is certified. If a recount occurs after certification, the recount will not be considered.",will-gallego-win-arizona-senate-election-by-3-or-more,2024-12-17T00:00:00Z,,0,,0,0,True,True,0xba0ef2255f1d335876774382d93286861310ab83bfebc5826ecd08803dabc900,0x7cc710b8b431b60e14e889b2372ea319dd1b164229bc2ed8352fd3dcd076905b,https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ruben+gallego.png,https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ruben+gallego.png,"{'rates': [{'asset_address': '0x2791Bca1f2de4661ED88A30C99A7a9449Aa84174', 'rewards_daily_rate': 100}], 'min_size': 20, 'max_spread': 3.5}",False,"[{'token_id': '55856503555818859651953843189924970698140085282373352594696227126322707967219', 'outcome': 'Yes', 'price': 0.065, 'winner': False}, {'token_id': '54474862753007187346116856932086932507492803516289165858470811682662970033261', 'outcome': 'No', 'price': 0.935, 'winner': False}]","['US Election', 'Margin of Victory', 'Politics', 'Senate']"
